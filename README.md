Reading Sensors using Arduino
==

Back in college, during my third year undergraduate's degree we tried building a green house monitoring system. We never finished it and also at the time we were using a different sensor. I decided to reproduce that project.

Granted, the entire project is amatuerish, but I really wanted to finish. Here I am using three sensors

- LM 37 type Temperature sensor
- An LDR
- A soil moisture sensor

In my software, I integrated [Arduino-Log](https://github.com/thijse/Arduino-Log). It is pretty great!
